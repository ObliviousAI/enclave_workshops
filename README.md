# The Enclave Workshop Series ðŸ“º

This repository is composed of a series of workshops on the theory and practice of using secure enclaves as a privacy enhancing technology (PET). If you have never come accross the concept of a secure enclave, not to worry as we will eneavour to start right from the beginning.

Enclaves, also known as trusted execution environments (TEEs) or confidential compute (CC), can be motivated by multiple drivers, including:

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Enhanced%20Security%20Transparency-%23FFC17A) <sup>Minimizing the attack surface of data throughout its life cycle</sup>

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Multiparty%20Computation-%231191AB) <sup>Brokering trusted computation between multiple parties who each input either data or algorithms</sup>

In the workshops below, we will tage each workshop with the above tags so you can easily navigate towards topics most relivent to you. We will also use one more tag which will be used for generic fundamental topics in enclaves:

3. How do we write software to deploy to an enclave?
  a. How to manage access control.
  b. How to allowlist outbound connections.

<sup>_Workshop Length Estimate:_ 30 minutes.<sup>

In this workshop, we'll cover:

1. A brief recap of enclave fundamentals.
2. An introduction to (differentially private) synthetic data.
3. Why connect sensitive data sources in an enclave? 
4. A walk-through of building and interacting with a (differentially private) synthetic data enclave service.
5. Comparing the utility of enclave-generated joint synthetic data with synthetic data generated.
