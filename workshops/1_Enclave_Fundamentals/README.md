<sup>_Workshop Length Estimate:_ 30-60 minutes.<sup>

In this workshop, we'll cover:

* What are secure enclaves?
* What types of enclaves are there? 
* How do we write software to deploy to an enclave?
  * How to manage access control.
  * How to allowlist outbound connections.
  * How to make enclaves configureable (without effecting their attestation).
* How do we configure and deploy a secure enclave?
* How can we securely connect to an enclave?

### How do we write software to deploy to an enclave?
  
For this we will be talking through the workshop resource [Source Code](https://github.com/oblivious-demo/oblv-fastapi). 
This repository uses Pythons FastAPI framework to demonstrates:
  * How to manage access control.
  * How to allowlist outbound connections.
  * How to make enclaves configureable (without effecting their attestation).

### How can we securely connect to an enclave?
  
The final step is to connect to the enclave from a computer or server. To do so, we will leverage the light-weight `oblv` cli proxy from Oblivious.
